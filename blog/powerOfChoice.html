        <h3>The Power of Choice<br><small>- November 9, 2016</small></h3>
        <p>Hello readers. I was considering starting this blog with the phrase "Hello World", as is the case with many CS ventures, but I was never a fan of that. When I was first learning Java I decided to diverge from the book's instructions and I wrote
            <code>System.out.println("Hello Arun");</code>. I thought I was so cool for doing that. I guess that was one of the first choices I made since I have started learning CS. Ultimately an inconsequential choice, but one I don't regret making.
            Since then, I've never followed a tutorial that's told me to print out "Hello World" and I've always replaced it with my own fun string.
            <br>
            <br> I may have gotten a bit off-topic. This entry is a partially an introduction to how I will structure my future posts and partially a full post itself. Most of my future entries will have some sort of focusing idea. You might be wondering
            why I decided to start writing in the first place. I spend much of my time thinking about abstract ideas. Some of them I ponder for just a few seconds; others I've spent years thinking about. I've never taken the time to write these down or
            materialize them. I had never really thought about changing that. But there are plenty of sources that show that writing for fun is healthy. While I've never been the greatest in English class, I do find enjoyment in free writing and expressing
            myself. And that's why this blog exists.
            <br>
            <br> The ability to make a choice is one that most people take for granted. It makes sense, since we make hundreds, maybe thousands of decisions a day. Often it is only when we lose the ability to make a decision that we truly appreciate the
            choices we are able to make. Today is election day in the US, and millions of Americans will have the ability to vote. Inevitably not all of these people will vote, and only some of these eligible voters are even registered to vote. Now American's
            voting process isn't perfect (I might talk about the concept of perfection in some other entry), but everyone can vote, right? Other than a few special cases, most people over the age 18 can "choose" to vote. However, reality is more complicated
            than that. Having Election day on a Tuesday puts a burden on many people who work, especially because it isn't a national holiday. Those with hourly wages end up losing precious time and money by spending hours waiting in lines. According
            to the
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/17/why-dont-americans-vote-were-too-busy/">Washington Post</a>, 28% of people who didn't vote chose not to because they were "too busy". It makes sense that people who are just
            trying to make a living don't want to spend the time in lines just to vote when they feel their vote won't matter. So while legally a person can have the option of voting, practically they do not have the choice to do so. It's important to
            take into account both the literal and implicit consequences of actions. This is the reasoning for the liberal opposition against voter ID laws. There isn't enough evidence to prove that voter fraud is a problem, and in practice ID's make
            the voting process more difficult and decrease voter turnout. As you can see, making a decision is not as simple as thinking about what theoretically will happen. You must also think practically and about the secondary effects of any actions.
            <br>
            <br> Another thing to keep in mind when making choices is <i>opportunity cost</i>. The opportunity cost of a decision is what you lose by going down that path rather than another. For example I made the decision to major in Computer Science,
            one of the opportunity costs was not being able to major in Physics (technically I could double major or eventually switch my major but neither of those are the same as going in as a Physics major; also I don't want to major in physics). In
            a world where we aim to have everything, it can be difficult to accept the fact that there are opportunity costs with every decision we make, big or small. I made the choice to learn how to use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>            for this website a few days ago. It took me around two hours learning how Bootstrap worked and incorporate that into this site. I could have spent those two hours on homework or studying or even learning some other programming language. Looking
            back I'd probably still choose the option and learn Bootstrap. The point is that every action, even seemingly irrelevant ones, has an opportunity cost because of the time we spend on it.
            <br>
            <br> Long story short, there is power in being able to choose. We make so many choices a day that we don't even realize them. We choose to drive to work instead of taking the bus. We choose to have a salad instead of a slice of pizza. Right
            now you are choosing to read this blog. You have the power to stop reading at any point and never look at this again. But you can also decide to keep reading this and keep following these posts (I might spend time learning how to make an RSS
            feed or something of that sort). I'll end off this post with a quote, something I plan on continuing in the future.
