                <p>
                    This is an algorithm that solves <a href="https://udel.edu/~os/riddle.html">Einstein's Riddle</a>. Einstein's riddle involves 5 houses of 5 different colors, each with owners of different nationalities who have their own unique tastes
                    of cigars, beverages, and pets. To solve the puzzle, one must deduce which house has the fish using a set of 15 clues.

                <h3>Arloper's Algorithm - 2016</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the implementation of a simple heuristic algorithm for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)</a>. The TSP involves a a salesman who starts at city and wants
                    to visit n different cities before returning to his home town. He wants to find the optimal path through so that he spends the least amount of time travelling. We can represent this abstractly as an undirected weighted cycle. The only
                    true solution to this problem, however, is to to use exhaustive search and identify every single possible cycle, which has a running time of O(n!) which isn't exactly ideal. The TSP is a NP-complete problem. This project is the implementation
                    of Arloper's Algorithm, a heuristic that runs in on average O(nlog(n)) with worst case O(n^2) running time.

                <h3>Hexagonal Game of Life - 2016</h3>
                <p>This is an implementation of hexagonal version of <a href="https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/">Conway's Game of Life</a>. Rather than have a grid of squares, this version uses a grid of hexagons. We had to slightly modify the rules to deal
                    with the fact that there are six sides, rather than just four. Unlike cubes, which have 2 different axes (up and down and right and left), the hexagons have 3 different axes. This has benefits and consequences. Having 3 axes allows
                    for interesting new elements such as rotation that aren't seen in the original version. However, one of the consequences it is cannot easily be implemented in a two dimensional array. In the github repository, there are demo files
                    of notable patterns we found. This was built for Purdue's Hello World Hackathon.

                <p>
                    This is a web app based on the game League of Legends that allows users to try out different item builds on their champions. To use, simply click on the champion you want to test a build with on the main page. When on the champion page, click the items
                    to add them to the build and see how the stats are changing. To remove an item, simply click on it in the build section.
